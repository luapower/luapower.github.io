					<h2 id="anatomy-of-a-package">Anatomy of a package</h2>
<p>There are 5 types of luapower packages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Lua module</strong>: written in Lua, compatible with LuaJIT2, Lua 5.1 and optionally Lua 5.2</li>
<li><strong>Lua/C module</strong>: written in C using the Lua C API, compatible with LuaJIT2, Lua 5.1 and optionally Lua 5.2</li>
<li><strong>Lua+ffi module</strong>: written in Lua using the LuaJIT ffi extension, compatible with LuaJIT2 and optionally with Lua ffi; the C library it binds to is included in the package in source and binary form</li>
<li><strong>C module</strong>: binary dependency or support library for other module; source and binary included</li>
<li><strong>other</strong>: none of the above: media/support files, etc.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-layout">The Layout</h3>
<ul>
<li>main module: <code>foo.lua</code></li>
<li>submodule: <code>foo_bar.lua</code> and if you really have to, <code>foo/bar.lua</code></li>
<li>ffi cdef module: <code>foo_h.lua</code> (ok to embed cdefs in <code>foo.lua</code> for small APIs)</li>
<li>test program: <code>foo_test.lua</code></li>
<li>demo: <code>foo_demo.lua</code></li>
<li>documentation: <code>foo.md</code>, <code>foo_bar.md</code> (pandoc markdown)</li>
<li>C libs &amp; Lua/C libs:
<ul>
<li>sources: <code>csrc/foo/*</code></li>
<li>build scripts: <code>csrc/foo/build-&lt;platform&gt;.sh</code>
<ul>
<li>platforms are named mingw32, mingw64, linux32, linux64, osx32, osx64, android.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>binaries (resulted from building):
<ul>
<li>C libraries: <code>bin/mingw32/foo.dll</code>, <code>bin/linux32/libfoo.so</code></li>
<li>Lua/C libraries: <code>bin/&lt;platform&gt;/clib/foo[.dll|.so]</code></li>
</ul></li>
<li>description: <code>csrc/foo/WHAT</code> (see below)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>exclude file: <code>foo.exclude</code> (see below)</li>
<li>LuaJIT executable: <code>bin/&lt;platform&gt;/luajit[.exe]</code></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>These conventions allow packages to be safely unzipped over a common directory and the result look sane, and it makes it possible to extract package information and build the package database.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-docs">The Docs</h3>
<p>Docs should start with a yaml header:</p>
<pre><code>---
project: spheroboom
tagline: defeats scammers
---</code></pre>
<ul>
<li>the <code>project</code> field should match the git project's name (makes the github buttons appear).</li>
<li><code>platforms: platform1, ...</code> should be added for Lua packages that are platform-specific but don't have a C component (eg. <a href="winapi.html">winapi</a>; for packages with a C component, adding the build scripts is enough to figure out the supported platforms).</li>
</ul>
<p>You don't have to make a doc for each submodule if you don't have much to document for it.</p>
<h3 id="the-what-file">The <code>WHAT</code> file</h3>
<p>The WHAT file is used for packages that have a C component (Lua+ffi, Lua/C or C packages), and it's used to describe that C component.</p>
<ul>
<li>the first line should read <code>&lt;name&gt; &lt;version&gt; from &lt;browse-url&gt; (&lt;license&gt;)</code></li>
<li>the second line should read <code>requires: package1, package2, ...</code> and it is only needed if the package has any <em>binary</em> dependencies which are not also Lua dependencies (eg. <a href="cairo.html">cairo</a> needs <a href="pixman.html">pixman</a> this way).</li>
<li>after the first two lines and an empty line, you can type in additional notes, whatever, they aren't parsed.</li>
</ul>
<p>The WHAT file can also be used to describe Lua modules that are developed outside of luapower (eg. <a href="lexer.html">lexer</a>).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Extracting dependencies from the dll itself and figuring it out from there is a project for another day.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-exclude-file">The <code>exclude</code> file</h3>
<p>This is the .gitignore file used for excluding files between packages so that files in one packages don't show as untracked files in other package. Another way to think of it is the file used for reserving name-space in the luapower directory layout.</p>
<p>Example:</p>
<pre><code>*                    ; exclude all files
!/foo*               ; include files in root that start with `foo`
!/foo/               ; include the directory in root named `foo`
!/foo/**             ; include the contents of the directory named `foo`, recursively</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>NOTE: Double-asterisk patterns are Git 1.8.2+.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="the-code">The Code</h3>
<ul>
<li>adding at least a small comment on the first line of every Lua file with a short tagline (what the module does), author and license can be a huge barrier-remover towards approaching your code (adding a full-screen of legal crap on the other hand is just bad taste - IMHO).</li>
<li>adding a comment on top of the <code>foo_h.lua</code> file describing the origin (which files? which version???) and process (cpp? by hand?) used for generating the file adds confidence that the C API is complete and updated.</li>
<li>don't use <code>module()</code> if you can help it (we had that debate too many times already)</li>
<li>use <code>ffi.load()</code> without paths, custom names or version (let the OS find the lib; the only compatible version is that which you tested the binding against and you included in the package)</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-build-scripts">The Build Scripts</h3>
<p>Write a build script for each supported platform. Ideally, your build script is a gcc one-liner like most build scripts around here. Writing gcc one-liners is quite easy for most C libraries. You only have to remember a few important gcc switches:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>-I&lt;dir&gt;</code> : search path for headers</li>
<li><code>-l&lt;libname&gt;</code> : dynamic library dependency (without the <code>lib</code> prefix)</li>
<li><code>-L&lt;dir&gt;</code> : search path for library dependencies</li>
<li><code>-static-libstdc++</code> : static linking of the C++ standard library (so that it doesn't become a runtime dependency)</li>
<li><code>-static-libgcc</code> : static linking of the GCC library (so that it doesn't become a runtime dependency)</li>
<li><code>-O2</code> : enable code optimization</li>
<li><code>-s</code> : strip debug symbols (makes the binary smaller)</li>
<li><code>-D&lt;name&gt;</code> : set a <code>#define</code></li>
<li><code>-D&lt;name&gt;=&lt;value&gt;</code> : set a <code>#define</code></li>
<li><code>-pthread</code> : enable pthread support (Linux only)</li>
<li><code>-fpic</code> : PIC mode (required for 64bit)</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="example-compile-lpeg-for-linux32">Example (compile lpeg for linux32):</h4>
<pre><code>gcc -O2 -s -static-libgcc lpeg.c -shared -o ../../bin/linux32/clib/lpeg.so -I. -I../lua -ansi -DNDEBUG</code></pre>
<p>In some cases it's going to be more complicated than that.</p>
<ul>
<li>sometimes you won't get away with <code>*.c</code> -- some libraries rely on the makefile to choose the C files that need to be compiled for a specific platform or set of options (eg. <a href="socket.html">socket</a>)</li>
<li>some libraries actually use one or two of the myriad of defines generated by the <code>./configure</code> script -- you might have to grep for those and add more <code>-D</code> switches to the command line.</li>
<li>some libraries have parts written in assembler or other language, in which case you will have to do compilation and linking in separate steps. At that point, a (simple) makefile becomes a good alternative.</li>
</ul>
<p>Bigger and more configurable libraries will need more options for sure, and some libraries rely on the build system to make too many decisions. But even large libraries like <a href="cairo.html">cairo</a> can be build with simple shell scripts without compromising on clarity or flexibility.</p>
<h3 id="binaries">Binaries</h3>
<p>Ideally, you would test your build scripts against the standard luapower <a href="building.html">building</a> environments. Spare luapower users for having to add another tool to their toolchain.</p>
<h2 id="publishing">Publishing</h2>
<h3 id="publishing-on-luapower.com">1. Publishing on luapower.com</h3>
<p>The way you add modules to luapower.com is:</p>
<ul>
<li>first you make a git repo that resembles a luapower package</li>
<li>then you can either:
<ul>
<li>publish it under your github account (luapower users will clone from your account directly)
<ul>
<li>ask me to add it to the package database</li>
<li>I'll periodically pull and update the website</li>
</ul></li>
<li>publish it <em>and manage it</em> yourself under the luapower github account (it's an org account)
<ul>
<li>ask me to add you as an admin</li>
<li>you will periodically push and update the website</li>
</ul></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="what-to-add">What to add</h3>
<p>Ideally, your lib has:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>distinction</strong> - focused problem domain</li>
<li><strong>completeness</strong> - exhaustive of the problem domain</li>
<li><strong>API documentation</strong> - so it can be integrated into the website</li>
<li><strong>test and/or demo</strong> - so it can be seen to work</li>
<li><strong>a non-viral license</strong> - so it doesn't impose restrictions on <em>other</em> modules</li>
</ul>
<p>Ideally, your lib is not:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <strong>glue library</strong> - lack of focus (by design)</li>
<li>a <strong>language abstraction library</strong> - except DSLs (discuss)</li>
<li>a <strong>lowest common denominator library</strong> - unless direct access to the backends is included too</li>
<li>an <strong>alternative take</strong> on another binding in the database (one should win)</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>It might be that your idea of a good package to add to luapower diverges too much from mine, in which case I would politely refuse to add your package to luapower. But here's where you can have your cake and eat it too.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="forking-luapower.com">2. Forking luapower.com</h3>
<p>Luapower can be used as web <em>software</em> for publishing Lua modules.</p>
<p>Luapower is composed of:</p>
<ul>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/luapower/luapower.github.io">static website</a> generated with pandoc templating</li>
<li>a <a href="https://github.com/luapower/luapower-git/blob/master/luapower.lua">Lua script</a> for updating the package database, navigation tree, and dependency lists offline</li>
<li>a few <a href="https://github.com/luapower/luapower-git">simple shell scripts</a> for working with git in a shared-work-tree environment</li>
</ul>
<p>Which means that with a few forks and a few tweaks you can have your own luapower clone with your own modules on it. I'll write a section on how to configure a luapower clone if there's interest in the idea.</p>
