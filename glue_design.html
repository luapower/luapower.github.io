					<h2 id="scope">Scope</h2>
<p>A small, highly useful bag of tricks.</p>
<p>This API must be <em>compact, not complete</em>. This is the one API that should fit comfortably in someone's head. Adding rarely used or too specialized functions is thus harmful.</p>
<p><em>Every</em> function should come with compelling real-world examples in its defense. In fact, the library should only be permitted to grow from real-world examples which should be used to document and justify the inclusions.</p>
<h2 id="naming">Naming</h2>
<p>The idea is to find the most popular, familiar and <em>short</em> names for <em>each and every</em> function (no underscores and no capitals). Python gets this right, so does UNIX. A function with an unheard of name or alien semantics will be avoided. People rather recall known names/semantics rather than learn unfamiliar new names/semantics.</p>
<p>For non-obvious O(n) operations, use verbs to emphasize the process rather than the result, eg. <code>scan(t,e)</code> not <code>indexof(e,t)</code>, <code>count(t)</code> not <code>size(t)</code>.</p>
<h2 id="semantics">Semantics</h2>
<p>They follow the general <a href="api-design.html">api-design</a> rules.</p>
<h3 id="objects-vs-glue">Objects vs glue</h3>
<p>Don't provide data structures like list and set in a glue library, or a way to do OOP. Instead just provide the mechanisms as functions working on bare tables. Don't do both either: if your list type gets widely adopted, your programs will now be a mixture of bare tables (this is inevitable) and lists so now you have to decide which of your lists has a <code>sort()</code> method and which need to be wrapped first. A global <code>glue.sort(t)</code> spares you the trouble.</p>
<h3 id="write-in-lua">Write in Lua</h3>
<p>String lambdas, callable strings, list comprehensions are all fun, but even the simplest DSLs have a learning curve, complex semantics and performance corner cases, and become a barrier to reading other people's code. I remember loathing having to use Lua's unfamiliar regex language with non-linear performance to do all of my string chores.</p>
<p>Adding DSLs make reading code frustrating. Why not give them <em>an identity of their own</em> and ship them as individual libraries and see if they can claim the required learning time from programmers by themselves.</p>
<h3 id="sugar">Sugar</h3>
<p>Don't add shortcut functions except when calling the shortcut function makes the code more readable than the equivalent Lua code.</p>
<p>If something is an [tricks idiom], don't add a function for it, use it directly. Chances are its syntax will be more popular than its name. Eg. it's harder to recall and trust semantic equivalence of <code>isnan(x)</code> to the odd looking but mnemonic idiom <code>x ~= x</code>. That doesn't mean <code>a &lt; b and a or b</code> is an idiom for <code>min</code> though, <code>min</code> itself is the idiom as we know it from math (wish there were a <code>sign()</code> function too).</p>
<p>Functional programming sugars like <code>compose</code> and <code>bind</code> makes code harder to read because brains are slow to switch between abstraction levels unless it's a self-contained DSL with radically different syntax and semantics than the surrounding code. Eg. it's relatively easy to read a Lua string pattern or an embedded SQL string more than it is reading expressions involving <code>bind</code> and <code>compose</code> which force you to simulate the equivalent Lua syntax in your head.</p>
<p>Sugars like &quot;message %s&quot; % arg are the good ones: % is odd enough to put after a string constant that it has an idiomatic quality, and its semantics is self-evident by reading the format string literal, even for someone who never heard of python's <code>%</code> operator. Also, a prefix notation is generally more readable than a function call.</p>
<h2 id="implementation">Implementation</h2>
<p>Keep the code readable (didactically when possible) and compact. Code changes that compromise these qualities for optimization should come with a benchmark to justify them.</p>
<p>Document the limits of the algorithms involved with respect to input, like when does it have non-linear performance and how it is stack bound. Performance characteristics are not an implementation detail.</p>
