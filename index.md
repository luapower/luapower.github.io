The rest is mostly free as-in non-viral, but licenses are listed so you can choose for yourself.

## Get Started

Download [luajit] and other packages you want along with their listed dependencies, and unzip them
_over the same directory_. This will give you an instantly **portable luajit distro** that will work
reagardless of where you run it from.
You will find luajit in `bin/<your-platform>/` already configured to look for Lua modules in `../..`
(that is relative to the executable's dir, not the dir the executable is started into).
Binaries can then be [rebuilt][building] if desired.

Alternatively you can go the git way with [luapower-git] which allows you to clone/build everything in one shot
and you keep your modules in sync by pulling.

> NOTE: Dependencies are not listed anywhere for demos and test units, so I'll just tell you now:
some test units need [unit], and most demos need [cplayer] and [glue].

> NOTE: Packages marked `dev` are _realy_ in development. Try at your own risk.
